Co-developed a 12-week curriculum to introduce non-technical students to real-world data analysis.

### Project Summary
This course was designed for students at a Japanese vocational school (専門学校) with no prior background in data analysis.

The goal was to equip them with practical skills in:
- data manipulation (with Python and Pandas),
- exploratory data analysis (EDA),
- and building simple machine learning models. 


By the end of the 12-week program, each student selected a dataset of personal interest and built a mini data project around it.

### My Contribution
- Developed core instructional content using Google Slides and Colab notebooks.
- Designed the Week 10 - 12  project sprint, guiding students from idea to prototype.
- Created learning outcomes and weekly activities that integrated tightly across the course to build confidence step-by-step.
 
The course is now actively being taught by my supervisor as part of the school's curriculum.
