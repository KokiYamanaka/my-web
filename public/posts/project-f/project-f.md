### Project Summary
- Children’s app startup: Delivers daily seasonal trivia to expand children’s curiosity  
- **Main objective**: Entertain children whose parents are busy  
- Our company developed the app from 0  
- The client wanted a new system to generate children’s content using Twitter  
  - e.g., if a child has never seen a specific tropical fish, use Twitter data to introduce it  

### My Contribution
- Joined the marketing team to understand their needs  
- Used pre-collected tweet posts from 21 aquariums in the Kanto region  
  - Applied vectorization and clustering to the tweet data  
  - Analyzed post frequencies and time-series trends for each aquarium  
  - Identified key topic categories tweeted by 20+ Japanese aquariums  
  - Evaluated whether using aquarium-based content could effectively introduce new topics to children before full-scale implementation  
- Compiled an analysis report, summarized findings, and presented insights to the marketing team
